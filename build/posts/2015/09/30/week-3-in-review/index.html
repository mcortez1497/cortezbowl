          <p>The season is in full swing now, and things are just getting started. Booms and busts are starting to emerge from the draft and the weekly waiver wire grind has started. How has the 3rd week of the NFL season treated the <strong>CORTEZ Bowl</strong> competitors? Let&#39;s see...</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-who-dat-mamassacre">The Who Dat Mamassacre</h2>
<p><em>Ho boy, what a beating.</em> It was said last week in the review, that <strong>Who Dat Mama</strong> was a couple of good performances away from turning around their fortune, and that fortune became reality this week, as they <em>destroyed</em> the <strong>Texas State BOBCATS</strong> with the score of <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=1&amp;scoringPeriodId=3&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">155 - 85</a>. Falcons RB <strong>Devonta Freeman</strong> emerged like a newly freed man, and ran all over the Cowboys for 141 YDs and 3 TDs, totaling <em>37pts</em>.</p>

  <span class="caption">Mama, there goes that man!</span>
</div>

<p>An amazing performance, but it was almost <em>equaled</em> by Bengals WR <strong>A.J. Green</strong>, who totaled 227 YDs and 2 TDs of his own, racking up <em>34</em> pts. Amazing breakout performances for both of these guys, backed up by great outings from other players like TE <strong>Greg Olsen</strong>, WR <strong>Brandon Marshall</strong>, and QB <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> ensured that this week, everyone would remember the words of Freddie Mercury - </p>

<h2 id="the-kill-streak-starts">The Kill Streak Starts</h2>
<p>Despite the Cowboys losing this week, <strong>Cortez the Killers</strong> and their cast of Cowboy players keep the slaughter coming, winning the <a href="http://mcortez1497.github.io/cortezbowl/posts/2015/09/24/game-of-the-week-fantasypros-breakdown/index.html">Game of the Week</a> against the <strong>Austin Killer Kitties</strong> by the score of <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=6&amp;scoringPeriodId=3&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">116 - 92</a>. RB <strong>Joseph Randle</strong> slashed through the Falcons in the first half to total up 87 YDs and 3 TDs, enough for an incredible 27pts. The same couldn&#39;t be said for <strong>Terrance Williams</strong>, who could be considered DOA without <strong>Tony Romo</strong> slinging the ball around. </p>
<p>That didn&#39;t seem to matter too much though, as other killers on the fantasy squad like RB <strong>Adrian Peterson</strong> and the <strong>Broncos DST</strong> murdered their opponents and raked in the points. Colts QB <strong>Andrew Luck</strong> came back from the brink of death against the Tennessee Titans, throwing some late TD passes to steal the game and salvage his fantasy performance for the week.</p>

</div>

<p>The <strong>Austin Killer Kitties</strong> didn&#39;t fare as well, as Lions QB <strong>Meow-thew Stafford</strong> was trampled by the top ranked <strong>Broncos DST</strong>, giving up two picks. The Kitties needed Stafford to have a huge game to emerge victorous, but instead, the Broncos had themselves a <em>fancy feast</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-miracle-on-monday-night-pt-iii">The Miracle on Monday Night, Pt. III</h2>
<p>In true <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong> fashion, it came down to Monday Night Football and the <strong>Green Bay Packers</strong>.</p>
<p>Straining performances by the rest of the <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong> squad left them down <em>40pts</em> with only two players left to play. Enter <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> and <strong>James Jones</strong>. Although a former Packer, <strong>James Jones</strong> has been <em>cut</em> by the Oakland Raiders and the New York Giants for not being <em>good enough</em>, but <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> knows the talent Jones has. With <strong>Jordy Nelson</strong> out for the season with a torn ACL, and supposed stand out <strong>Devante Adams</strong> unable to play the first few weeks with an <em>ankle injury</em>, Jones has stepped up to the plate. He brought in 139 YDs and one of <strong>Aaron Rodger&#39;s</strong> <em>5</em> touchdowns, giving the duo a combined point total of <strong>53pts</strong>. </p>

<p>The <strong>Pouncing Pandas</strong> had good performances by RB <strong>Frank Gore</strong> and RB <strong>Latavius Murray</strong>, each bringing in 20pts, but it wasn&#39;t enough for the pouncing the Packers put on. The big problem for the Pandas though, is the pounding QB <strong>Ben Roethlisberger</strong> took. A nasty hit to the knee will have him sidelined for up to six weeks, meaning <strong>Panda&#39;s</strong> backup QB <strong>Cam Newton</strong> and the pouncing Panthers are out for blood.</p>

<h2 id="surveying-the-wreckage-team-ducky">Surveying the Wreckage: Team Ducky</h2>
<p>Another week, another wrecking. <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=9&amp;scoringPeriodId=3&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">124-90</a>.</p>
<p>The Patriots <strong>Tom Brady</strong> and <strong>Stephen Gostowski</strong> feasted on the jagged <strong>Jackonsville Jaguars</strong> defense this week for a combined 39pts, and WR <strong>Julio Jones</strong>, the most-targeted recieiver in the NFL, went wild on the Cowboys for 28pts. Throw in Packers WR <strong>Randal Cobb</strong> for another 28pts and you have a bonafide wrecking crew.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Team Ducky</strong> falls to 0-3, as the running back core has not been pulling it&#39;s weight. But, with the likes of <strong>Peyton Manning</strong> and <strong>Rob Gronkowski</strong> on the roster, the team can quickly turn into the <strong>Mighty Ducks</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="ironman-melted">IRONMAN Melted</h2>
<p>The <strong>Heat</strong> have gone full blast. <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=7&amp;scoringPeriodId=3&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">97-82</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="center">
  <span class="caption">A real facemelter.</span>
</div>

<p>QB <strong>Andy Dalton</strong> went nuclear for the <strong>Heat</strong> this weekend, throwing for 383 YDs and 3 TDs, totaling 30pts. Combined with running backs like &quot;fresh-off-suspension&quot; first round pick <strong>Le&#39;Veon Bell</strong> and <strong>Dion Lewis</strong>, the <strong>Heat</strong> have themselves a real firing squad. They&#39;re sitting at 2-1, with more ammunition looking to come off suspensions on the bench. Locked and loaded, the <strong>Heat</strong> are ready for action.</p>
<p><strong>I AM IRONMAN</strong> had great points by the receivers. <strong>Demaryius Thomas</strong> and <strong>Larry Fitzgerald</strong> are sure to be double-digit producers each week, but the running back core failed to produce even 7pts combined. <strong>IRONMAN</strong> will hope for some technology to emerge and get those guys off the ground...</p>
