Week 1 is just on the horizon and the battle for the **CORTEZ BOWL** Championship is about to start! There’s fresh meat in the league, meaning that the first ever 10-man draft in **CORTEZ BOWL** history happened this weekend. Let’s look at what the experts at FantasyPros.com have to say about the teams leading into kickoff:

Taking full advantage of the number 1 overall pick in this year’s draft, **Wreck Support** is a bonafide wrecking machine heading into the first week of the NFL season, leading the top of the charts in Power Rankings. Following close behind is last year’s runner up champion, the **Pouncing Pandas**, who’s looking for redemption and to be reigning champ once again. After the **BOBCATS**, we see the first of the newcomers, **I AM IRONMAN**, backing up a successful inaugural draft by coming up 4th in the Power Rankings. Further and further down in *9th*(!) place we find our defending champs, the **Twisted Ankles**. At least in the first week, the experts say that this could be a tough year for the defending champs. They’ll need to refine their roster or hope their prophetic pickups pay off if they want to three-peat and become a dynasty!

Now that we know an overview of what’s happening this year, let’s breakdown what exactly is going on in the the top spot lineup:

</div>

Boasting the best of the best in the **RB1**, **WR1**, **WR2**, and **K** spots, **Wreck Support** is looking to overwhelm the opposition with pure, raw talent. Number 1 overall pick **Eddie Lacy** highlights a star-studded offense that includes the one-two tandem of **Julio Jones** and **Randall Cobb**, as well as Mr. Deflategate himself **Tom Brady**. **Wreck Support** has decided to turn a blind-eye to Brady’s questionable conduct and flat-football preferences and instead, use Brady to deflate the opponent’s confidence.

Now that we know what’s going on with the top, what’s going on with the *bottom*:

</div>

With a whopping *THREE* players suspended on the **Houston Heat**, there’s a good chance of getting burned. First round draft-pick and RB stud **Le’Veon Bell** is the marquee suspended player in Week 1 that may make the inaugural week of football for the Heat go up in smoke. That’s not to say they’re completely burned out, though! Handcuffed back **Deangelo Williams** will look to spark the offense for this week, and there is a hot spot on the roster in #1 ranked **Dolphins DST** going up against a combusting Redskins offense. The Heat are definitely playing with fire with some untested players like **Melvin Gordon**, **Joique Bell**, and **Sam Bradford**. But if they are able to light up the scoreboard this weekend, the Heat can easily scorch anyone in their way!
