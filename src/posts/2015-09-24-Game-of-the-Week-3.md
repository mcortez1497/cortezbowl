For Week 3, we'll be looking at our **Game of the Week**, which is a battle between last week's top scorer and one of the league's few remaining unbeatens. We'll check out the analytics from [FantasyPros](http://www.fantasypros.com) to breakdown the matchup and predict who comes out on top! Without further ado...

  <h3>(1-1) Cortez the Killers v. (2-0) Austin Killer Kitties</h3>

[FantasyPros](http://www.fantasypros.com) uses it's expert picks to calculate a score for each team in the league. The score is based on analysts' fantasy football predictions for *this week*, meaning these are very much in tune with NFL Week 3. Using their overall scoring results, let's see where the two teams land:

Looking at the overall score, the pros are saying that **Cortez the Killers** have the stronger team this week. Let's dig inside and see what the expectations are:

</div>

Unsurprisingly, the pros *love* this week's receiving core of **Odell Beckham Jr** and **Emmanuel Sanders**. For good reason too, as they dropped *20pts each* last week. And matchups against Washington and Detroit respectively mean they are expected to make it rain for a second week in a row. The pros are also not deterred by **Andrew Luck** and the poor showing the Colts have had in the first two weeks. Luck is still considered the 3rd best option at QB this week against the Tennessee Titans. The other killer piece of the team this week, is the dominating **Broncos DST**, who are the number one scoring defense in fantasy through 2 weeks. Last week's *5* turnover performance against Kansas City ensured that. And they are facing a Detroit team this week that has a banged up **Matthew Stafford** at the helm.

What else is interesting about that? the **Austin Killer Kitties** are *starting* the Lions' (and fellow kitty) **Matthew Stafford** due to the injury of their original starting QB **Jay Cutler**! If the 0-2 Detroit Lions are able to put it together this week and get a top notch performance out of **Matthew Stafford**, the **Austin Killer Kitties** could swipe a huge number of points from **Cortez the Killer's** Bronco defense, all while racking up points themselves. Or it could go the way the pros predict, which is a dominating performance for the **Broncos DST**. Either way, the Denver @ Detroit game will be instrumental in deciding this game. Giddy up!

Let's take a look at the rest of the **Austin Killer Kitties** lineup and see where they might succeed this week.

It's been a rough first two weeks for TE **Jimmy Graham** and RB **DeMarco Murray**, but the pros still have their faith in them! They are both ranked 3rd in their respective positions this week. **Jimmy Graham** is facing a Chicago Bears team who just [*gave up the most points at home in franchise history*](http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-gamerecap/Bears-struggle-in-all-phases-in-defeat/1fd83391-693e-4210-82dd-3767065dab67) last week, which bodes well for the Seahawks. **DeMarco Murray** is facing a red hot Jets team, so the pros must have a lot of faith that the Eagles offense is just one game from putting it all together. RB **Chris Ivory**, on the contrary, has had a great start to his season for the Jets, and hopes for that to continue against the Eagles. It is worth noting that **Chris Ivory** is listed as questionable this week, so he may be a game time decision come Sunday.

The pros don't have Jaguar's WR (and fellow kitty) **Allen Robinson** ranked highly, only 9th this week. But the **Austin Killer Kitties** will need big production, like last week's *27pt* performance, against the Patriots this week if they hope to claw out the victory.

Follow the Game of the Week this weekend, and good luck to both teams!
