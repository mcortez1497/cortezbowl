Analyzing the rosters heading into Week 2, the experts at [FantasyPros](http://www.fantasypros.com) have predicted the strongest players based on their real-life matchups. They have been ranked relative to the rest of the fantasy league at their positions. Let's breakdown the top of the list and see what the experts have predicted:

Multiple #1 options in multiple roster spots make the **BOBCATS** the strongest roster for Week 2. Although **Drew Brees** is a mid-to-high tier QB as it stands, a matchup at home against a Tampa Bay defense that gave up 42 points to rookie QB **Marcus Mariota** sets up Brees for a lot of success. the same can be said for **Jamaal Charles** and **Justin Forsett**, going against a shaky Broncos team and a sad Oakland team, respectively. The biggest question marks on the roster are the constantly changing tight ends, because the **BOBCATS** can't make up their mind, and receiver **Jordan Matthews**, who butterfingered a catch into an interception on Monday night.

Let's inspect the bottom of the list:

The experts feel like the **Twisted Ankles** twisted roster may have some rough matchups this week. **Aaron Rodgers** remains a stellar start, but the running and receiving core of the team is looking at subpar matchups this week. **Julian Edelman** looks to face a stingy Buffalo DST and **Giovani Bernard** is currently only a backup option in Cincinnati. The shallow depth at these positions is highlighted by the injuries to studs Dez Bryant and **T.Y. Hilton**. The **Twisted Ankles** are looking to survive these early weeks, then ride out the end of the season when it's receiving corps get healthy. The brightest spot on the **Twisted Ankles** this week, is the KICKER! *Wooooooooooo*
