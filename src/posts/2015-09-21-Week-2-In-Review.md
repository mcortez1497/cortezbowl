## With The Patriots Support, They Keep Wrecking

Despite losing their #1 overall pick **Eddie Lacy** to injury, **Wreck Support** continues to it's journey of destruction by winning this week over **Who Dat Mama**, [98 - 89](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&teamId=11&scoringPeriodId=2&seasonId=2015&view=scoringperiod&version=quick).

Riding the wave of patriotism, meaning **Tom Brady's** 28pts and **Stephen Gostowski's** 19pts, **Wreck Support** was able to cruise to victory despite the zero-burger posted by **Eddie Lacy**. All-star studs **Julio Jones** and **Randall Cobb** also contributed double-digit points to help pad the lead and secure a 2-0 start to the season.

**Who Dat Mama** falls to 0-2, but shows promise with **Matt Ryan**, **Brandon Marshall**, **A.J. Green**, and **Mason Crosby** all posting double-digit point totals of their own. The team only needs some extra contribution from guys like rookie **T.J. Yeldon** to become a contender.

## IRONMAN Meets Their Killer

After emerging from the first week a winner, **I AM IRONMAN** ran into the strangehold of **Cortez the Killers** this weekend, who sliced open the competition with multiple 20+ point performances and emerged the victor, [112 - 75](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&teamId=11&scoringPeriodId=2&seasonId=2015&view=scoringperiod&version=quick). **Odell Beckham Jr** made it rain, despite the incompetent Giants cast around him, and is showing flashes of what made him a prime early draft pick this year. One thing to remember though, is that **OBJ** is on the cover of Madden 16 this year. The Madden curse looks to have subsided so far, but **Cortez the Killers** will need to appease John Madden to keep the curse at bay for the rest of the season!

</div>

**I AM IRONMAN** is still solid with a .500 record, but is dealt a hard blow by losing **Tomo Romo** to his fractured clavicle injury. The team will need some huge performances from **Larry Fitzgerald** and **Marshawn Lynch** going forward, if they want to keep **IRONMAN** running.

## Kitties v. Duckies - The Battle of the Century

In a clash of the adorable titans, the kitties we're able to claw out a victory, [75 - 68](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&teamId=10&scoringPeriodId=2&seasonId=2015&view=scoringperiod&version=quick).

</div>

Both teams had numerous letdowns from some of their key players. For the **Austin Killer Kitties**, QB **Jay Cutler** went down with an injury early, and poor performances by TE **Jimmy Graham**, RB **DeMarco Murray**, and the **Bills DST** had the team howling for answers. The surprising 155 YDs, 2 TD performance by Jacksonville Jaguar (and fellow kitty) **Allen Robinson** is what pushed the **Kitties** over the top, putting in an incredible 27pts.

**Team Ducky** was hoping to get some more out of the Denver Broncos' **Peyton Manning** and **C.J. Anderson**, although Manning was able to salvage the week with two late touchdown throws in the last two minutes of the game. The team is hoping that disappointing performances by WR **Keenan Allen** and K **Adam Vinatieri** are one-time flukes, and not consistent habits.

## Pandas get Pounced

Drama happens on Monday Night.

Sitting with a comfortable lead before the Jets @ Colts matchup, the **Pouncing Pandas** looked to have the game in hand, boasting a *93 - 80* lead. The **Pandas** hoped to ride this lead to victory, but the Monday Night Football game took a wild turn. With the Colts down 10 - 0 heading into the 4th quarter, the running game was abandoned, and it was time for **Andrew Luck** to air it out. The Colts top wide receiver, **T.Y. Hilton**, was questionable leading into this game, so the **Houston Heat** started the next best option...

Down 13 points... Needing a miracle...

<div class="center">
  <span class="caption">There's no need to grief, with **Donte Moncrief**.</span>
</div>

WR **Donte Moncrief** stepped up and brought in the Colts only touchdown of the night, and also had 7 catches for 122 YDs to go with it, for a total of 18pts. Just enough to cover the 13pt lead the **Pouncing Pandas** had.

But the **Pouncing Pandas** *also* had a player on Monday Night. Old standby, RB **Frank Gore**, who managed to rush for 57 YDs, enough for 5pts. Which, if we do our math right, would be enough to tie the game *98 - 98*. But the game ended in **Houston Heat**'s favor, [98 - 96](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&teamId=7&scoringPeriodId=2&seasonId=2015&view=scoringperiod&version=quick). What gives?

Well, old standby **Frank Gore** managed to fumble the ball... And lose it... on his way to a touchdown... on the 1 yard line...

## Ankles Eek It Out Again On Monday Night

Another thriller, decided on Monday Night.

On early Sunday, the matchup went back and forth as each team had some decent performances by the likes of **Jamaal Charles**, **Cardinals DST**, **Julian Edelman**, and **Aaron Rodgers**. A huge break came for the **Twisted Ankles** as the Bengals/Bobcats starting RB **Jeremy Hill** caught a bad case of fumble-itis, fumbling twice before being put in the dog house, finishing the game with *-1pt*. This terrible illness paved the way for backup RB, and **Twisted Ankles** starter, **Giovani Bernard** to rush for a big game. He totaled 123 YDs for 13pts.

Prior to the Monday Night game, the **Texas State BOBCATS** held a *4pt* lead over the **Twisted Ankles**, who only had one player left to play - veteran wide receiver for the Jets, **Eric Decker**. And on the very first drive of the game, **Eric Decker** caught a touchdown pass to seal away the game for the **Twisted Ankles**, winning [94 - 83](http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&teamId=1&scoringPeriodId=2&seasonId=2015&view=scoringperiod&version=quick).

A quote from the **Twisted Ankles** owner:

> Although the Twisted Ankles team may have been stricken by the injury bug and considered, by some, to be short on talent, they're not short on heart. For the second week in a row, the two-time defending champion delivered what could only be described as the "Miracle on Monday Night"
