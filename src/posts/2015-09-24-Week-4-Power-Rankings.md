**Wreck support** still remains supreme on top, as the rest of league scrambles around beneath them. The teams in the **West** division took a huge leap this week, as the **Twisted Ankles**, **Cortez the Killers**, and **Houston Heat** all rose up 2 spots, showing the strength of the division. The defending champ **Twisted Ankles** have gotten off to a great start, but the rest of the division will be clipping at their heels (ankles?) to get that top spot.

In the **East** division, both 0-3 teams take up the bottom of the power rankings - **Texas State BOBCATS** and **Team Ducky**, who will be facing off against each other this week! One team will fall to *0-4*, while the other will be, well - *still pretty bad*. Regardless, **Wreck Support** holds a firm grip on the division. But **Who Dat Mama** has emerged as a force to be reckoned with after a slow start.

The season continues this weekend! Good luck to the competitors!
