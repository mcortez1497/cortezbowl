Prior to the late Monday night game, the **Houston Heat** were sitting comfortable with a 98 - 79 lead over the **Twisted Ankles**. A 19 point lead with only a *single* player left to play?

But newly-appointed starting San Francisco RB **Carlos Hyde** would have *none* of it.

High tide started early for Hyde as he gutted the Vikings for 168 yds and 2 TDs. There was little hype for the 49ers going into the season, and most of the hype for the team was around Aussie Rugby star **Jarryd Hayne**, a handsome bloke who unfortunately happened to fumble away a punt return and land him in the dog house (kangaroo house?). Sorry mate. With a star needing to rise up in **Frank Gore**'s absence, Hyde took the reins and exploded for 29 points, marking an epic comeback for the **Twisted Ankles**, and a huge burn for the **Houston Heat**.
