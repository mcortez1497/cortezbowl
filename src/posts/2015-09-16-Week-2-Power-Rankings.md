With convincing wins from the top 2 teams in the first week, Wreck Support and Pandas keep their spots at the top of the Power Rankings, and looking to keep it that way as they face the bottom 2 teams (Who Dat Mama and Houston Heat) in the Power Rankings respectively in week 2. A huge upset be either team would be a huge blow to the confidence of the top 2 teams, but it will definitly be tough to accomplish. Further down the rankings, Week 1 winners I AM IRONMAN, Killer Kitties, and Twisted Ankles all climbed the charts a couple of spots, with the Week 1 losers slowly trending downwards. Twisted Ankles was certainly lucky to eek out a close win, but not lucky enough, as stud receiver Dez Bryant is ironically out with a foot injury, seriously hurting the depth of the defending champs.
