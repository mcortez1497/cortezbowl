With convincing wins from the top 2 teams in the first week, **Wreck Support** and **Pouncing Pandas** keep their spots at the top of the Power Rankings, and looking to keep it that way as they face the bottom 2 teams in week 2, **Who Dat Mama** and the **Houston Heat**. An upset for either team would be huge this early in the season, but it will definitely be tough to accomplish.

Further down the rankings, Week 1 winners **I AM IRONMAN**, **Austin Killer Kitties**, and **Twisted Ankles** all climbed the charts a couple of spots, with the Week 1 losers slowly trending downwards. **Twisted Ankles** was certainly lucky to eek out a close win, but not lucky enough, as stud receiver **Dez Bryant** is ironically out with a foot injury, seriously hurting the depth of the defending champs.
