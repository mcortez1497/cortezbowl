<h2 id="with-the-patriots-support-they-keep-wrecking">With The Patriots Support, They Keep Wrecking</h2>
<p>Despite losing their #1 overall pick <strong>Eddie Lacy</strong> to injury, <strong>Wreck Support</strong> continues to it&#39;s journey of destruction by winning this week over <strong>Who Dat Mama</strong>, <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=11&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">98 - 89</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>Riding the wave of patriotism, meaning <strong>Tom Brady&#39;s</strong> 28pts and <strong>Stephen Gostowski&#39;s</strong> 19pts, <strong>Wreck Support</strong> was able to cruise to victory despite the zero-burger posted by <strong>Eddie Lacy</strong>. All-star studs <strong>Julio Jones</strong> and <strong>Randall Cobb</strong> also contributed double-digit points to help pad the lead and secure a 2-0 start to the season.</p>
<p><strong>Who Dat Mama</strong> falls to 0-2, but shows promise with <strong>Matt Ryan</strong>, <strong>Brandon Marshall</strong>, <strong>A.J. Green</strong>, and <strong>Mason Crosby</strong> all posting double-digit point totals of their own. The team only needs some extra contribution from guys like rookie <strong>T.J. Yeldon</strong> to become a contender.</p>

<h2 id="ironman-meets-their-killer">IRONMAN Meets Their Killer</h2>
<p>After emerging from the first week a winner, <strong>I AM IRONMAN</strong> ran into the strangehold of <strong>Cortez the Killers</strong> this weekend, who sliced open the competition with multiple 20+ point performances and emerged the victor, <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=11&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">112 - 75</a>. <strong>Odell Beckham Jr</strong> made it rain, despite the incompetent Giants cast around him, and is showing flashes of what made him a prime early draft pick this year. One thing to remember though, is that <strong>OBJ</strong> is on the cover of Madden 16 this year. The Madden curse looks to have subsided so far, but <strong>Cortez the Killers</strong> will need to appease John Madden to keep the curse at bay for the rest of the season!</p>

  <span class="caption">&quot;Hey, you know who I&#39;d never curse? Brett Favre.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p><strong>I AM IRONMAN</strong> is still solid with a .500 record, but is dealt a hard blow by losing <strong>Tomo Romo</strong> to his fractured clavicle injury. The team will need some huge performances from <strong>Larry Fitzgerald</strong> and <strong>Marshawn Lynch</strong> going forward, if they want to keep <strong>IRONMAN</strong> running.</p>

<h2 id="kitties-v-duckies-the-battle-of-the-century">Kitties v. Duckies - The Battle of the Century</h2>
<p>In a clash of the adorable titans, the kitties we&#39;re able to claw out a victory, <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=10&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">75 - 68</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="center">
  <span class="caption">&quot;Meow. Quack.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Both teams had numerous letdowns from some of their key players. For the <strong>Austin Killer Kitties</strong>, QB <strong>Jay Cutler</strong> went down with an injury early, and poor performances by TE <strong>Jimmy Graham</strong>, RB <strong>DeMarco Murray</strong>, and the <strong>Bills DST</strong> had the team howling for answers. The surprising 155 YDs, 2 TD performance by Jacksonville Jaguar (and fellow kitty) <strong>Allen Robinson</strong> is what pushed the <strong>Kitties</strong> over the top, putting in an incredible 27pts.</p>
<p><strong>Team Ducky</strong> was hoping to get some more out of the Denver Broncos&#39; <strong>Peyton Manning</strong> and <strong>C.J. Anderson</strong>, although Manning was able to salvage the week with two late touchdown throws in the last two minutes of the game. The team is hoping that disappointing performances by WR <strong>Keenan Allen</strong> and K <strong>Adam Vinatieri</strong> are one-time flukes, and not consistent habits.</p>

<h2 id="pandas-get-pounced">Pandas get Pounced</h2>
<p>Drama happens on Monday Night.</p>
<p>Sitting with a comfortable lead before the Jets @ Colts matchup, the <strong>Pouncing Pandas</strong> looked to have the game in hand, boasting a <em>93 - 80</em> lead. The <strong>Pandas</strong> hoped to ride this lead to victory, but the Monday Night Football game took a wild turn. With the Colts down 10 - 0 heading into the 4th quarter, the running game was abandoned, and it was time for <strong>Andrew Luck</strong> to air it out. The Colts top wide receiver, <strong>T.Y. Hilton</strong>, was questionable leading into this game, so the <strong>Houston Heat</strong> started the next best option... </p>
<div class="center">
Down 13 points... Needing a miracle...

<div class="center">
  <span class="caption">There&#39;s no need to grief, with <strong>Donte Moncrief</strong>.</span>
</div>

<p>WR <strong>Donte Moncrief</strong> stepped up and brought in the Colts only touchdown of the night, and also had 7 catches for 122 YDs to go with it, for a total of 18pts. Just enough to cover the 13pt lead the <strong>Pouncing Pandas</strong> had.</p>
<p>But the <strong>Pouncing Pandas</strong> <em>also</em> had a player on Monday Night. Old standby, RB <strong>Frank Gore</strong>, who managed to rush for 57 YDs, enough for 5pts. Which, if we do our math right, would be enough to tie the game <em>98 - 98</em>. But the game ended in <strong>Houston Heat</strong>&#39;s favor, <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=7&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">98 - 96</a>. What gives?</p>
<p>Well, old standby <strong>Frank Gore</strong> managed to fumble the ball... And lose it... on his way to a touchdown... on the 1 yard line...</p>

<h2 id="ankles-eek-it-out-again-on-monday-night">Ankles Eek It Out Again On Monday Night</h2>
<p>Another thriller, decided on Monday Night.</p>
<p>On early Sunday, the matchup went back and forth as each team had some decent performances by the likes of <strong>Jamaal Charles</strong>, <strong>Cardinals DST</strong>, <strong>Julian Edelman</strong>, and <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong>. A huge break came for the <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong> as the Bengals/Bobcats starting RB <strong>Jeremy Hill</strong> caught a bad case of fumble-itis, fumbling twice before being put in the dog house, finishing the game with <em>-1pt</em>. This terrible illness paved the way for backup RB, and <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong> starter, <strong>Giovani Bernard</strong> to rush for a big game. He totaled 123 YDs for 13pts.</p>
<p>Prior to the Monday Night game, the <strong>Texas State BOBCATS</strong> held a <em>4pt</em> lead over the <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong>, who only had one player left to play - veteran wide receiver for the Jets, <strong>Eric Decker</strong>. And on the very first drive of the game, <strong>Eric Decker</strong> caught a touchdown pass to seal away the game for the <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong>, winning <a href="http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/boxscorequick?leagueId=569656&amp;teamId=1&amp;scoringPeriodId=2&amp;seasonId=2015&amp;view=scoringperiod&amp;version=quick">94 - 83</a>.</p>
<p>A quote from the <strong>Twisted Ankles</strong> owner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although the Twisted Ankles team may have been stricken by the injury bug and considered, by some, to be short on talent, they&#39;re not short on heart. For the second week in a row, the two-time defending champion delivered what could only be described as the &quot;Miracle on Monday Night&quot;</p>
